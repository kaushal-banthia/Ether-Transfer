# Ether-Transfer
Web Application built using Javascript and Solidity, which transfers Ethereum from one wallet to another, using smart contracts.

Uses MetaMask for the Wallet.

Currently working only on the Ropsten Test Network. Would soon implement it on the Mainnet network.

To run, cd into the client/eth folder and then run the command: npm run dev
