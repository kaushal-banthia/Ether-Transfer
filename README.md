# Ether-Transfer
Web Application built using Javascript and Solidity, which transfers Ethereum from one wallet to another, using smart contracts.

Uses MetaMask for the Wallet.

Currently working only on the Ropsten Test Network. Would soon implement it on the Mainnet network.

## Installation


## To generate Ropsten ETH
Try the following links
- https://faucet.ropsten.be
- https://faucet.dimensions.network
- https://faucet.metamask.io
- https://ropsten.oregonctf.org (I found this to work the best. It also gives the highest amout of rETH per day and is very fast)
- https://faucet.egorfine.com

## Usage
Run the following commands
```bash
cd blockchain/client/eth
npm run dev
```
Then click on the link that pops up in the Terminal / Command Prompt (Link is localhost:3000)\

Fill out the form and click on "Send Now" to send your rETH to the other wallet.
